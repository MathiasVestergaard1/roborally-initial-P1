Things we have added:
We have added walls which the player cannot move through, they work from both directions.
We have also added conveyor belts, that move the player in the direction of the conveyor belt.
These are not yet fully implimentet, but the functionallity is there and we have added two test obstacles, that are hardcoded for now.
We also added save/load funcitonality, that saves the locations of all the players.
